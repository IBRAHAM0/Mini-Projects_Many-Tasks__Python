# Netflix Movie Data Analysis: Insights from the 1990s

## Project Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix's movie dataset, focusing specifically on films released during the 1990s. The aim is to identify key insights related to movie durations and genre-specific trends, particularly for action movies, to inform strategic content decisions.

## Objectives

- Determine the most frequent movie duration for films released in the 1990s.
- Count how many action movies were considered short (less than 90 minutes) during this decade.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Python Programming:** Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas Library:** Used to clean, filter, and analyze the Netflix movie data.
- **Matplotlib Library:** Employed for visualizing the distribution of movie durations.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:**

   - Imported Netflix data (`netflix_data.csv`) using pandas.
   - Filtered dataset to include only movies (excluded other content types).

2. **Filtering by Decade:**

   - Narrowed dataset to include movies released strictly between 1990 and 1999.

3. **Visualization:**

   - Created a histogram to visualize movie duration distribution.
   - Identified the most frequent duration visually from the histogram.

4. **Action Genre Analysis:**

   - Further filtered movies to the "Action" genre.
   - Counted movies with a duration under 90 minutes.

## Insights

- **Most Common Movie Duration:** Approximately 90 minutes was identified as the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s.
- **Short Action Movies Count:** (Replace with actual number) Action movies were shorter than 90 minutes during the 1990s.


## Conclusions

The analysis revealed important trends about movie lengths and genre-specific characteristics of the 1990s, providing a foundation for strategic insights into audience preferences and production planning.
