# NYC Public Schools SAT Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This data analysis project utilizes standardized test performance data from New York City's public schools. The goal is to analyze and uncover insights regarding math performance, overall SAT scores, and variations across boroughs, helping stakeholders understand school performance patterns.

## Objectives
- Identify NYC public schools with the highest math scores.
- Determine the top 10 performing schools based on combined SAT scores (Math, Reading, and Writing).
- Identify which NYC borough exhibits the greatest variability in SAT scores.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python Programming:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy Libraries:** For data cleaning, statistical calculations, and sorting.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Import and Initial Exploration:**
   - Loaded SAT performance data into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Previewed the dataset to understand structure and key features.

2. **Top Math Schools:**
   - Filtered schools achieving at least 80% of the maximum math SAT score (640 points).
   - Ranked and identified top schools based on the average math SAT score.

3. **Top 10 Overall SAT Performance:**
   - Computed total SAT scores by summing math, reading, and writing scores for each school.
   - Identified and listed the top 10 schools based on these combined scores.

4. **Borough-Level Analysis:**
   - Calculated combined SAT scores for each school.
   - Determined the borough with the largest standard deviation, indicating variability in SAT performance.

## Insights
- **Best Math Schools:** Identified NYC public schools with notably high math performance (average scores â‰¥640).
- **Top 10 Overall Schools:** Listed the highest-ranking schools based on total SAT scores, reflecting overall academic excellence.
- **Borough Performance Variability:** Highlighted the borough showing the most significant variability in student SAT scores, indicating uneven performance.


## Conclusions
This project provided valuable insights into performance levels across NYC's public schools, highlighting schools excelling in math and overall SAT performance. The borough-level analysis offers critical insights for educators and policymakers to address disparities and promote equitable education outcomes.
